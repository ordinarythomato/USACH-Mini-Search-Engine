This project was the final assignment of my Fundamentals of Engineering Programming class (2nd semester), where the primary software tool was Python. I achieved learning about GUI basics with tkinter and pillow libraries, as well as logic creation for basic desktop software.
I intend to add new features soon, such as a restart button or improved image loading for the pictures used.
